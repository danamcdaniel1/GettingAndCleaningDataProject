The purpose of this repository is to hold a data-processing script and tidy data that cleans data downloaded from here on 06/20/15:
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The core data set contains Samsung Galaxy S II measurements from thirty volunteers aged 19-48.
All actions required to reproduce the data are saved in the file `run_analysis.R`.

### Core files
* `run_analysis.R`
* `codebook.MD`
* `readme.MD`

### Overview for `run_analysis.R`
1. Requirements as specified in the Coursera course are embedded within the script as comments in the form of `# STEP X  description of requirement`.
2. Relevant data files area read from the unzipped data set.
3. Test and Training data sets are merged together by subject id.
4. We extracts some "pre-processed"" accellerometer and gyroscope data that's clearly labeled by mean() and std().
5. Labels are added to identify which actions are "walking," "sitting," etc.
6. Results are aggregated.
7. tidyData.txt is exported as tab-separated file.

### More information
More information on interpreting the code from `Run_analysis.R` is found in `codebook.MD`
